Hi Joe,
This quarter I have to learn more advanced skills from all classes and somehow
they over cross and make me confused.

I have some confusion in my work.

in function isAllDataValid(),
I have to get all values from the input to validate the data.

In getBabyProduct(), I have to do the same thing, but with the 'product.' 

Can I call all values in the main and then in getBabyProduct(), I set
	product.productName = productName;

I am trying to use ul to show error messages.
I have learned and been practicing doing everything in TS/JS without touching HTML
and it's kind of amazing.

One thing, when I click on the button leaving all textbox empty again and again, 
it keeps adding error messages.

Then, I added this code (it doesn't look good) in addProduct():  
    // prevents displaying repeated error messages
    if (getByID("validationUL").getElementsByTagName("li").length > 3){
        clearErrMsg();
    }
It clears the entire err msg ul, and it displays err msg again when the button clicked again

What should I do to clear the err msg without adding the above code?
